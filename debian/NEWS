propellor (3.0.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  This version of Propellor introduces a new dependency on the
  concurrent-output Haskell library.  If you were using a version of
  Propellor older than 2.17.2 when you last ran propellor --spin to
  spin any of your hosts, running propellor --spin on those hosts with
  Propellor version 3.0.0 will fail to install the dependency and so
  the spin will fail.

  To deal with this, login as root to each of the hosts that were last
  spun with a version older than 2.17.2, and execute the following
  commands:

      cd /usr/local/propellor
      make clean

  For a full explanation of why this is necessary, see

  For a guide to upgrading your config.hs for Propellor version 3, see
